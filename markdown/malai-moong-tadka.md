Whole moong dal or mung bean or green gram is a very healthy, high protein gram widely used in Indian cooking. My grandmother makes it quite often and we enjoy it with hot steaming rice.

One day, I thought to give the Moong tadka a creamy twist and it was appreciated by everyone. Malai Moong Tadka is a creamy, delicious curry with aromatic spices.
