Whole moong dal or mung bean or green gram is a very healthy, high protein gram widely used in Indian cooking. My grandmother makes it quite often and we enjoy it with hot steaming rice. One day, I thought to give the Moong tadka a creamy twist and it was appreciated by everyone. Malai Moong Tadka is a creamy, delicious curry with aromatic spices.

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 30 to 45 minutes

###Ingredients
*Main ingredients*
- 1 cup whole moong dal, boiled in a pressure cooker (if you would like to cook without a pressure cooker, soak the moong dal for two hours in three cups of water. Then, boil in a pot)
- 1 onion medium, diced 
- 2 tomatoes medium, diced
- 1/4 to 1/3 cup fresh cream
- 1 to 2 green chillies
- 1/2 inch ginger, diced
- 1 large garlic clove, diced
- 1-inch cinnamon
- 2 cloves
- 2 green cardamoms
- 1 medium bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 4 teaspoon cooking oil
- Salt to taste

*Garnishing*
- 2 teaspoon butter
- 2 tbsp fresh cream
- 1 teaspoon dry fenugreek
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 large red chilli or 2 to 3 small ones (optional: if you enjoy crunchy red chillies)
- 3 to 4 curry leaves
- 5 to 6 coriander chopped

###Procedure
*Moong dal*
- In a pan, add 2 teaspoon cooking oil and 1 tablespoon butter, this will make sure that the butter does not evaporate. 
- Once, the butter has melted, add the bay leaf, cardamoms, cinnamon, cloves and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. 
- Add the onions, garlic, ginger and green chillies. Cook till the onions turn translucent. 
- Add the tomatoes and let them cook. Once done, empty the contents in a plate and let them cool down to the room temperature. Finally, blend them in a fine paste. (If you want to avoid strong flavours, you can remove the dry spices and just blend the onion, ginger, garlic, green chillies and tomatoes. It will still have the aroma but will be mild)
- In a pan, add 2 teaspoon cooking oil and 1 tablespoon butter, once the butter has started melting, add the cumin seeds. 
- Once the cumin seeds start to crackle add the blended puree and the red chilli powder. 
- Let the puree boil, then add the cooked moong dal. 
- Let it cook for 5 to 7 minutes and then add the fresh cream.
- Once it is boiled add salt to taste. 
- Empty the contents in a serving bowl and prepare for garnishing. 

*Garnishing*
- In a pan, add the butter. Once, the butter has melted. 
- Add cumin seeds, once they start crackling add the curry leaves, red chilli and dry fenugreek leaves. Cook for two to three minutes and then turn off the flame.
