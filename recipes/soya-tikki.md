Soya Mutter Cutlet are simple to make high protein snack. I make them quite often for a simple healthy lunch or dinner. In this recipe, the cutlets are served with mint and yogurt chutney. It is optional, you can serve it with our favourite sauce.

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 30 to 40 minutes

###Ingredients
*Soya Mutter Cutlet*
- 1.5 cup soya chunks
- 1 cup green peas
- 1 large potato, boiled
- 12 to 15 curry leaves
- 2 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 2 tablespoon cumin seeds
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link"> 1 tsp garam masala or ground spices </a>
- 1 
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 large lemon
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped coriander.

###Procedure
*Poha*
- In a strainer, add the poha and rinse it until it is soft. If the flake breaks easily between your thumb and index finger. It's done. 
- If it is still taking a lot of time, you probably have got thick poha, then soak in it 2.5 cups of water for 5 to 10 minutes. Check if it is soft or else allow some more time but make sure it does not get mushy. Drain the water once it is soft
- Empty the soft poha in a container, then mix the turmeric powder and salt to it.
- In a pan, dry roast 2 tablespoons roasted gram dal with 2 green chillies. Once the green chillies are almost cooked, blend them in a fine powder and mix it with the poha.

*Tempering*
- In a pan, add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them crackle. 
- Then add the cumin seeds and let them crackle.
- Then add the curry leaves, split black lentils and the remaining roasted gram dal. Stir it for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the chopped green chillies and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. The green chillies will get crispy, therefore the spice will be reduced. But feel free to reduce the green chillies based on your preference. 
- Add the poha and stir for 5 to 8 minutes. 
- Squeeze the lemon and add sugar. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. 
- Add the chopped coriander. 

Poha is ready to be served. Enjoy it hot.
