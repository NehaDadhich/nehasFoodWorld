Avocado Spread is an easy, quick and healthy recipe. I enjoy it with a <a href="avocado-spread" class="link"> grilled vegetable sandwich</a>. I enjoy spicy food that's why I have added some green chilli to this but you can skip it if you don't prefer spicy food.

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:**  10 to 15 minutes


###Ingredients
- Two large ripe avocado
- a large garlic clove, finely chopped
- a green chilli, finely chopped or 1/2 teaspoon green chilli paste (optional)
- a teaspoon of crushed black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice (adjust according to preference)
- 4 to 5 coriander sprigs chopped for garnishing
- salt to taste

###Tips
- Use well-ripened Avocados as they have a buttery and creamy pulp. 

###Procedure
- Cut the avocados in two halves and remove the seed.
- Using a spoon, scoop out the entire avocado flesh in a bowl.
- Use a potato masher to mash the avocado flesh in the bowl. You could use a fork too to mash avocado flesh if you like the spread to be chunky. I prefer the spread to be smooth so that it is easy to spread on sandwiches or wraps. 
- Then add finely chopped garlic clove, green chilli (or paste), crushed black pepper, salt to taste and lemon juice. Mix well. 
- Add chopped coriander sprigs and mix well. 

Avocado Spread is ready. It should be served immediately otherwise the avocados start turning brown. If you want to store the spread, then transfer it to an airtight container immediately and store it in the fridge.
