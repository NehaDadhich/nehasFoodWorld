Grilled Vegetable Sandwich is one of my favourite sandwiches. There are two ways to make the filling, one is with raw vegetables and the other is with stir-fired vegetables. Both are healthy, tasty and easy to make. 

This recipe is the stir-fried version. For the raw vegetable version, mix the vegetables with spices in a bowl. The raw vegetable filling is ready. I have used a sandwich griller for making sandwiches, if it is not available you can use a toaster or pan to toast bread and then add the spread and filling to the toasted bread.

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:**  20 to 30 minutes

###Ingredients
*Filling*
- A cup of grated cabbage

###Procedure
*Filling*
- In a pan, add two teaspoons of oil. Once the oil has heated, add grated cabbage, carrot, chopped beans and corn kernels. 
- Then add salt to taste, crushed black pepper powder and red chilli flakes. 
- Sauté the vegetables till the cabbage turns light golden. Then add chopped bell peppers and mix well. 
- Sauté for two to three minutes. The stir-fried vegetable filling is ready. 

*Sandwich*
- Take two slices of bread and apply a tablespoon of avocado spread or tomato spread or your favourite sauce. 
- Then add the prepared filling to one of the bread slices and place the other bread slice on top.

The grilled vegetable sandwich is ready, serve it with your favourite sauce or spread. The extra filling can be served as a salad.
