Methi Mutter Malai is a creamy curry made with fengureek leaves and green peas in a tomato and onion gravy. While green chillies are added to spicy this curry because of the cream, raisins and sugar this curry has a bit of sweet taste so it is best to serve it with a spiced bread or rice. If you can't find fenugreek leaves you could try this recipe with spinach.
