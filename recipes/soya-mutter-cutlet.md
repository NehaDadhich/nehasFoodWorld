Soya Mutter Cutlets are simple to make high protein snack made with soya and green peas. In this recipe, the cutlets are served with mint and yoghurt chutney. It is optional, you can serve it with your favourite sauce.  For the sauce in the image, I have used dairy yoghurt but I have tried it with soya yoghurt or other vegan yoghurt and it turns out great.

**Serves:** 15 cutlets\
**Cooking Time:** 30 to 40 minutes

###Ingredients
*Soya Mutter Cutlet*
- 1/2 cups soya granules
- 1/2 cups green peas
- 1 large potato, boiled and mashed
- 2 tablespoon gram flour
- 6 to 8 curry leaves
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link"> 1 tsp garam masala or ground spices </a>
- 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ginger garlic paste
- oil for shallow fry
- salt to taste

*Mint Yoghurt Sauce*
- 1/2 cup yoghurt
- 3 tablespoon mint
- 2 to 3 green chillies
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seed powder (if unavailable, dry roast 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds and finely powder them)
- black salt to taste (use normal salt if unavailable)

###Procedure
*Soya Mutter Cutlet*
- Soak the soya granules in 1 cup of hot water for 10 minutes. Once it has cooled down, squeeze out the water and empty in a bowl. 
- Add the peas and mashed potato to the soya granules. 
- Add the curry leaves, sesame seeds, cumin seeds, red chilli powder, gram flour, salt and  ginger garlic paste
- Start mixing all the ingredients well. Try making a cutlet and ensure it does not break easily. 
- If it breaking easily, add little gram flour and try again. 
- (For a crispy coating, you could make corn flour and all-purpose flour paste, dip the cutlets in the paste and coat with breadcrumbs).
- In a pan, add oil and shallow fry the cutlets. (Try with a smaller one and see if it breaks. If it is breaking a lot, the mixture is probably a bit moist, add some gram flour or all-purpose flour or breadcrumbs to dry it a bit.)
- Shallow fry the cutlets till they turn golden. 

Soya Mutter Cutlets are ready. Serve with your favourite sauce or the Mint Yoghurt Sauce below:
