![Khatta Meetha Poha](./images/khatta-meetha-poha.png) 

Khatta means sour in Hindi and Meetha means sweet, this dish is an unique combination of contrasting flavours. Poha is flattened rice which are very easy to cook. Tempering is an important element of poha as it adds an amazing texture to it. My mom makes it quiet frequent and she taught me this recipe. 

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 15 to 20 minutes

###Ingredients
- 2 cups poha (flattened rice) (Alternatively, you can use cooked rice, if you don't have poha. Please make sure that rice are cooked soft but not mushy)
- 3 tsp oil
- 8 to 10 curry leaves
- 1 tsp split black lentils (urad dal)
- 3 tsp roasted gram dal
- 5 to 6 green chillies, keep one aside and chop in about 1/2 inch size
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp tumeric powder
- 1 large lemon
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped coarinder.

###Procedure
*Poha*
- In a strainer, add the poha and rinse it until it is soft. If the flake, breaks easily between your thumb and index finger. It's done. 
- If it is still taking a lot of time, you probably have got thick poha, then soak in it 2.5 cups of water for 5 to 10 minutes. Check if it is soft or else allow some more time but make sure it does not get mushy. Drain the water once it is soft
- Empty the soft poha in a container, then mix the tumeric powder and salt to it.
- In a pan, dry roast 2 tsp roasted gram dal with 2 green chillies. Once the green chillies are almost cooked, blend them in a fine powder and mix it with the poha.

*Tempering*
- In a pan, add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them crackle. 
- Then add the cumin seeds and let them crackle.
- Then add the curry leaves, split black lentils and the remaining roasted gram dal. Stir it for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the chopped green chillies and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. The green chillies will get crispy, therefore the spice will removed. But feel free to reduce the green chillies based on your preference. 
- Add the poha and stir for 5 to 8 minutes. 
- Sequenze the lemon and add sugar. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. 
- Add the chopped coarinder. 

Poha is ready to be served. Enjoy it hot.
