Khatta means sour in Hindi and Meetha means sweet, this dish is a unique combination of contrasting flavours. Poha is flattened rice which is very easy to cook. Tempering is an important element of poha as it adds an amazing texture to it. My mom makes it quite frequently and she taught me this recipe. 

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 15 to 20 minutes

###Ingredients
- 2 cups poha (flattened rice)
- 3 tablespoon oil
- 8 to 10 curry leaves
- 1 tsp split black lentils (urad dal)
- 3 tablespoons roasted gram dal
- 5 to 6 green chillies, keep two aside and chop the remaining in about 1/2 inch size
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 large lemon
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped coriander.

###Procedure
*Poha*
- In a strainer, add the poha and rinse it until it is soft. If the flake breaks easily between your thumb and index finger. It's done. 
- If it is still taking a lot of time, you probably have got thick poha, then soak in it 2.5 cups of water for 5 to 10 minutes. Check if it is soft or else allow some more time but make sure it does not get mushy. Drain the water once it is soft
- Empty the soft poha in a container, then mix the turmeric powder and salt to it.
- In a pan, dry roast 2 tablespoons roasted gram dal with 2 green chillies. Once the green chillies are almost cooked, blend them in a fine powder and mix it with the poha.

*Tempering*
- In a pan, add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them crackle. 
- Then add the cumin seeds and let them crackle.
- Then add the curry leaves, split black lentils and the remaining roasted gram dal. Stir it for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the chopped green chillies and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. The green chillies will get crispy, therefore the spice will be reduced. But feel free to reduce the green chillies based on your preference. 
- Add the poha and stir for 5 to 8 minutes. 
- Squeeze the lemon and add sugar. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. 
- Add the chopped coriander. 

Poha is ready to be served. Enjoy it hot.
