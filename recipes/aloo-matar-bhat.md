Green peas, potatoes and rice are like a perfect combination which always turns out to be good. Aloo Matar Bhat is easy to make, mild and healthy meal perfect for lunch or dinner. 

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 30 to 45 minutes

###Ingredients
- 2 cups of rice
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut in small pieces
- 1/2 cup frozen peas ( fresh will be amazing but I didn't have them. )
- 1 medium tomato finely chopped
- 3 tsp oil
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 to 4 cloves
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp red chilly powder
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link"> 1 tsp garam masala or ground spices </a>
- salt to taste
- 1/4 tsp butter (only if frozen peas are used)
- 2 tsp coriander for garnishing


###Procedure
- *Note:* I have used a rice cooker to cook the rice, you can cook the rice directly too. 
- Start cooking the rice in a rice cooker or pot. 
- In the meanwhile, take a pan and add oil to it. 
- Once the oil has heated up add the mustard seeds and let them crackle. 
- Once it is done, add the cumin seeds and let them crackle. 
- Add the bay leaves and cloves. Stir for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the chopped potatoes to it and cook them till they get a bit crispy. ( Add peas now if they are fresh and cook with potatoes )
- Then add the chopped tomatoes with red chilly powder, turmeric powder, garam masala and salt to taste. 
- Once the tomatoes are cooked, add this cooked potato and tomato gravy to the rice, still cooking in the rice cooker or pot. 
- Give it a nice stir and let it cook. 
- The following step is only if you have used frozen peas or else skip to garnishing. 
- In a pan, add the butter and toss the peas for two to three minutes. Once the rice is about 85-90% done add these buttery peas to it and let it cook completely. (I prefer this step because frozen peas don't have a fresh aroma to it so I like to add some buttery aroma.)
- Once the rice is done, garnish with coriander. 

Aloo Matar Bhat is ready.
