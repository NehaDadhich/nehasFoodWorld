Kadai Paneer is a spicy paneer curry with crunchy capsicums, onions and tomatoes. It is traditionally made in Kadai (Indian wok) which gives an amazing flavour to the ingredients. It's totally fine if you don't have a Kadai, you can use a sauce pan. Adjust the spice level of this recipe as you prefer. For vegan recipe, you can tofu or any vegetables of your choice and skip the butter.
