Tomato Dal is a simple, healthy lentil curry of tomatoes. I like to use three kinds of lentils for a good texture and a unique flavour. You can still make this dal if all the three lentils are unavailable.

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:**  30 minutes

###Ingredients
- 1/2 cup of equal quantities of red split lentils, pigeon pea lentils and split husked mung lentils. Washed and soaked in half a cup of water for 15 to 20 minutes.
- 2 cups of water (reduce the quantity to half cup to increase the thickness.)
- 1-inch ginger crushed
- a teaspoon of finely chopped garlic
- 1.5 cups of tomatoes chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 7 to 8 curry leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- a teaspoon red chilli powder
- salt to taste
- Two tablespoons of oil
- 7 to 8 coriander sprigs chopped for garnishing

###Procedure
- In a pan, add the soaked lentils with 1.5 cups of water and cook until done. (You can pressure cooker dal too)
- In a pan, add oil and heat it for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the mustard seeds and once they crackle, add the cumin seeds and let them crackle.
- Add the curry leaves, crushed ginger and chopped garlic.
- Saut√© till the raw smell of ginger and garlic is gone.
- Add the tomatoes and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.
- Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the cooked dal and 0.5 cups of water.
- Add salt to taste and cook for five minutes.
- Garnish with chopped coriander.

Tomato Dal is ready to be served. Enjoy it with rice or your favourite bread or enjoy it on its own as a soup.
