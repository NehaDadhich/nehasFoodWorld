Haryali Tadka is spinach, moong beans and masoor dal curry. For this recipe, green chillies are used to spice the curry. Tempering is added twice for Haryali Tadka therefore it is higher in calories. To reduce calories, you can reduce the oil and avoid tempering the curry for the second time. 

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 40 to 50 minutes

###Ingredients
- 1/2 cup of whole moong dal, soaked for two hours
- 1/2 cup of masoor dal or red split lentils, soaked for 15 to 20 minutes
- 1 cup of chopped spinach
- 5 to 6 coriander sprigs chopped
- 5 to 6 green chillies (adjust according to spice preference)
- 1-inch ginger 
- 1.5 teaspoon of garlic finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds
- 1/4th teaspoon of asafoetida (don't add too much, the curry will get bitter)
- 5 to 6 curry leaves
- 2 dry red chillies whole
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon of coriander powder
- 2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons of oil
- salt to taste

###Procedure
*Cooking Dal*
- In a saucepan, add the soaked whole moong dal and masoor dal with 2 cups of water. Cook until the masoor dal has dissolved completely. Moong beans will give an amazing bite and masoor dal will give a thick and delicious texture. 
- Alternatively, you can also pressure cooker the dals.
- Add half a cup of water to the cooked dal and mash 1/3rd of the dal using a potato masher. Mashing will give a thick consistency however don't mash it completely. 

*Dal Curry*
- Blend the green chillies and ginger into a fine paste. 
- In a saucepan, add two tablespoons of oil. Once the oil has heated, add the mustard seeds and let them crackle. 
- Then add the cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Once they crackle, add the curry leaves, ginger-green chilli paste, chopped garlic and asafoetida. 
- Saute` for 2 to 3 minutes. Then remove one tablespoon of tempering into a small bowl, this will be reused for second tempering. 
- Add the chopped spinach and coriander sprigs. Saute` for 5 to 6 minutes. 
- Add the cooked dal along with turmeric powder, coriander powder, salt to taste along with water as required. Note: Spinach can get too salty easily that's why it is best to reduce the salt a little. You can always add again after tasting the curry.
- Cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally in the middle. 

*Second Tempering*\
Note: Second tempering should be added when the dish is ready to serve. Reheat the dal curry if required. 
- In a pan, add two teaspoons of oil. Once the oil has heated, add the stored tempering and two whole red chillies. 
- Saute` for 2 to 3 minutes or until the red chillies are done. 
- Add the second tempering to the dal curry.
