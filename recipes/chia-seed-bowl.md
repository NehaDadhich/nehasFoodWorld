Chia Seed Bowl is made by soaking chia seeds in milk or nut milk for two hours or overnight and then add fruits and nuts to it. For busy mornings, it can serve as a quick and healthy breakfast, you could soak them overnight then just add fruits and nuts in the morning.

**Serves:** 1\
**Soaking time:** 2 hours or overnight\

###Variations
- *Milk:* &nbsp; I have used unsweetened almond milk for this recipe. You could try any nut milk or coconut milk or dairy milk. 
- *Sweeteners:* &nbsp; Adding sweeteners is optional but I like to add some dates syrup and enjoy a sweet pudding. You could also try unrefined cane sugar, honey, brown sugar, maple syrup, sweetened chocolate sauce or any sweet fruit puree
- *Fruits:* &nbsp; You can add fruits like apple, banana, blueberries, cherries, grapes, strawberries, blackberries and mango (when in season)
