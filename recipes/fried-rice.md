Fried Rice is cooked rice tossed with vegetables, green chilli sauce and soya sauce. This is my dad's recipe.

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 30 to 45 minutes

###Tips
- Use matured basmati rice, the one used in this picture where 12 months matured basmati rice.
- Add lots of vegetables for a crunchy flavour. My dad normally adds equal quantities of vegetables and rice.
- Use two kinds of green chillies for making the sauce - mild and spicy. The mild one will give an amazing colour and the spicy one will give the flavour. You could also use green chilli sauce from any supermarket.
- Normally, fried rice is made in a large wok if you don't have a wok you could use a saucepan with a flat base.

###Notes
- Apart from the vegetables mentioned in this recipe, you could also add spring onion, baby corn, mushroom, bean sprouts and celery stalks.
