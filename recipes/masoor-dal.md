Masoor dal or red split lentils is a high fibre and easy to digest lentils. I cook it weekly as it is easy to cook and very healthy. 

**Serves:** 4\
**Cooking Time:** 30 minutes

###Ingredients
- 1/2 cup of masoor dal or red split lentils washed and soaked in half cup of water for 15 to 20 minutes.
- 2 cups of water (reduce the quantity to half cup to increase the thickness.)
- 1-inch ginger crushed
- 1 teaspoon dry fenugreek leaves
- 2 medium tomatoes chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 5 to 6 curry leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chilly powder
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoon oil
- 2 teaspoon coriander chopped for garnishing


###Procedure
- In a pan, add the oil and add the mustard seeds once the oil has heated.
- Once the mustard seeds crackle, add the cumin seeds and once they crackle, add the curry leaves and crushed ginger.
- Sauté till the raw smell of ginger is gone. 
- Add the fenugreek leaves and sauté for a minute.
- Add the tomatoes and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. 
- Add the soaked lentils and water. 
- Add turmeric powder and red chilly powder. Boil the dal for 15 to 20 minutes. If the dal is not cooked yet, boil for few more minutes. Stir occasionally in middle.
- Add salt to taste and cook for five minutes. 
- Garnish with chopped coriander.
